For this assignment, you will use a 2D ArrayList to answer a classic chess puzzle. (If you already know the answer, you can still complete this challenge--you will just be verifying your answer.)

Part 1: The Puzzle
A Knight in chess moves in the shape of a capital "L". (Two steps in any of the four cardinal directions followed by one step to either side, perpendicular to its initial motion.)

Imagine an infinite chessboard, where each space is given a number. You begin in the center with the space numbered 1, and number the squares by counting upwards and spiraling outward from that central square. If you are unclear on exactly how the spaces are numbered, stop and come see me. If you guess wrong, you will very likely need to start over.

In this puzzle, a single Knight begins on the 1 space and proceeds to make legal moves, with the restriction that if it has multiple legal moves it must take the one to the lowest numbered space. It also cannot land on the same space twice.

The puzzle: How far can the Knight get before it has no legal moves remaining?
